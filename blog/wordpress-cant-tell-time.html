    <p class="lead">Or maybe they meant hours instead of minutes? Either way, WordPress made a mistake on their getting started guide.</p>

    <p>While working as a website project manager at an agency, a coworker introduced me to WordPress. I immediately loved WordPress's idea after dabbling with code-based websites for a year.</p>

    <h2>Starting the Timer</h2>

    <p>I looked up how to create a WordPress website and found their famous "5-Minute Install." How could WordPress get any better, it helps stand up polished, functional websites, and it only takes 5 minutes to get started! I purchased a hosting plan and started building my first WordPress website. And, boy, those WordPress people were entirely off on how long it takes.</p>

    <p>Five frustrating hours later, I had finally stood up a WordPress installation. That means it took me 60 times as long as it should have. Sixty! I felt duped by WordPress.</p>

    <p>But, I was pretty happy with what was happening as I started to build. Even if it was just a black install screen:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>To be fair to WordPress, I was a novice at best in terms of web stack items needed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>FTP</li>
        <li>Hosting</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>LAMP/MAMP</li>
        <li>Anything outside of CSS/HTML</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That evening I spent hours googling about PHP, hosting, WordPress errors, how to use FTP, etc. After lots of trial and error, I installed WordPress, a bootstrap theme, and WooCommerce.</p>

    <p>The first website I built on WordPress was actually for a client. And since it was only going to take me 5 minutes to install, I figured I could also finish the website in a few hours of work, even though it was an eCommerce site.</p>

    <h2>Time Well Spent</h2>

    <p>Fast forward some 40 hours, and I had launched my first website with WordPress! It even had a working shopping cart. I was mentally exhausted but had never felt so encouraged about my future career path.</p>

    <p>Fast forward some ten more years, and I couldn't be more grateful for those 5 hours that should've only taken 5 minutes. I have built over 200 WordPress websites since and no longer even go through the famous "5-Minute Install" process.</p>

    <p>Now I use an automated process to stand up WordPress websites for me as I gather brand and content assets to build my next project.</p>

    <h2>Speeding Up Time</h2>

    <p>I can now say that my average time of installing a WordPress website is under 5 minutes. And I am recommending that WordPress change their lingo on their install guide. Here is what it should read:</p>

    <h3>"…WordPress is a very simple process and takes less than five minutes, on average, to complete."</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Useful marketing tools save time and help you produce value for your clients or business even if it takes 60 times as long to learn them as it should.</p>
